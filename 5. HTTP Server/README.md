### HTTP Server

**Overview**

HTTP Server:

Implemented a basic HTTP server capable of handling GET and POST requests.
Developed http_server.py to manage client connections and serve HTTP responses.
Demonstrated understanding of HTTP/1.1 protocol and web server functionalities.


#### HTTP_server_shell.py

**Constants and Configuration:**
- **IP, PORT, SOCKET_TIMEOUT:** These constants define essential server configuration parameters such as the IP address, port number, and socket timeout duration, ensuring flexible server setup and operation.
- **RESOURCE_FOLDER:** Specifies the directory path where server resources (files) are stored, facilitating easy access and management of served content.
- **REDIRECTION_DICT:** Provides a mapping of specific paths to redirect locations or files, enabling dynamic routing and resource redirection based on client requests.

**Functions and Handlers:**
- **get_file_data(filename):** Effectively retrieves data from a specified file in binary mode ('rb'). It incorporates robust error handling to manage potential issues such as FileNotFoundError and IOError, ensuring reliable file access operations.
- **validate_and_calculate(query_params, operation):** Validates query parameters received from client requests and performs calculations based on specified operation types (e.g., calculate_area or calculate_next), enhancing the server's capability to handle dynamic content generation and processing.
- **serve_client_request(resource, request_data, client_socket):** Serves as the main function to handle client requests. It encompasses functionalities such as managing redirections, processing dynamic calculations, and efficiently serving static files to clients, contributing to a versatile and responsive server operation.
- **handle_client(client_socket):** Manages individual client connections effectively. This function validates incoming HTTP requests, invokes serve_client_request to process client requests, and proficiently handles exceptions and socket timeouts, ensuring robust and uninterrupted client-server interactions.
- **main():** The central server loop that orchestrates server operations. It sets up the server socket, binds it to the specified IP address and port, listens for incoming connections, and delegates each client connection to handle_client for comprehensive request processing and response handling.
- **handle_interrupt(signum, frame):** A signal handler designed for SIGINT (Ctrl+C), ensuring graceful termination of the server when initiated, thereby enhancing server reliability and operational integrity.

#### HTTP_protocol.py

**Constants and Data Structures:**
- **VALID_METHODS:** Defines a set of valid HTTP methods supported by the server. Currently includes GET, with provisions for extending functionality to accommodate additional methods like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., as required.
- **STATUS_MESSAGES:** Maps HTTP status codes to their corresponding descriptive messages, facilitating efficient lookup and generation of response headers, thereby enhancing server communication clarity and effectiveness.
- **DEFAULT_BODIES:** Specifies default response bodies for common HTTP status codes. This includes static byte strings and lambda functions for dynamic content generation, ensuring consistent and appropriate responses across different server interactions.

**Functions:**
- **generate_response_header(status_code, content_type='text/html', location=None):** Generates an HTTP response header based on the specified status code, content type, and optional location (used primarily for redirects). This function ensures accurate and compliant HTTP response header construction, promoting consistent server communication standards.
- **generate_response_body(status_code, location=None):** Constructs the HTTP response body based on the provided status code, retrieving the appropriate body content from DEFAULT_BODIES. This function enhances response message coherence and relevance, catering to diverse client requirements effectively.
- **generate_status_code(status_code, content_type='text/html', response_body=None, location=None):** Integrates the generated response header and body into a complete HTTP response message. It calculates the Content-Length and returns the response as bytes, streamlining response message assembly and transmission for optimal client-server interaction.
- **get_content_type(filetype):** Determines the appropriate content type based on the file extension (filetype), facilitating accurate MIME type assignment for various file types served by the server. This function ensures compatibility and proper rendering of served content across different client platforms and environments.
- **validate_http_request(request):** Validates incoming HTTP requests to ensure compliance with supported HTTP methods (e.g., GET). It extracts the requested resource path, ensuring adherence to server capabilities and constraints, thereby promoting robust request handling and server performance.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the README provides comprehensive insights into the functionality and design of the HTTP server implemented in `HTTP_server_shell.py` and its associated protocol management in `HTTP_protocol.py`. The clear delineation of constants, configuration parameters, functions, and handlers demonstrates a well-structured approach to server implementation, fostering scalability, reliability, and efficient client-server communication. Enhancements focusing on further error handling and scalability considerations would further augment the server's capabilities in diverse operational scenarios, ensuring its suitability for both educational and professional network application purposes.
